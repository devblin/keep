# Docker-compose
The easiest way to start keep is by running it on docker-compose:
docker-compose up
``

# Kubernetes
Keep can be installed via Helm Chart using the following command:
```
helm repo add keephq https://keephq.github.io/helm-charts
helm pull keephq/keep
helm install keep keephq/keep
```

Notice for it to work locally, you'll need this port forwarding:
`kubectl port-forward svc/keep-frontend 3000:3000`
`kubectl port-forward svc/keep-backend 8080:8080`

For specifics, see https://github.com/keephq/keep/blob/main/chart/keep/README.md

# Development
You could use `docker-compose.dev.yaml` to start Keep in a development mode (see Dockerfile.dev.ui / Dockerfile.dev.api)
