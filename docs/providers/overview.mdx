Providers are core components of Keep that allows Keep to either query data, send notifications, get alerts from or manage third-party tools.

These third-party tools include, among others, Datadog, Cloudwatch, and Sentry for data querying and/or alert management, and Slack, Resend, Twilio, and PagerDuty for notifications/incidents.

By leveraging Keep Providers, users are able to deeply integrate Keep with the tools they use and trust, providing them with a flexible and powerful way to manage these tools with ease and from a single pane.
